<h2> About cat</h2><hr>
      <p>The Oriental Shorthair is a breed of domestic cat that is developed from and closely 
      related to the Siamese cat. <br>
      It maintains the modern Siamese head and body type but appears in a wide range of 
      coat colors and patterns. <br>
      Like the Siamese, Orientals have almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, 
      large ears, and an elongated, slender, and muscular body. <br>
      Their personalities are also very similar. <br>
      Orientals are social, intelligent, and many are rather vocal. <br>
      They often remain playful into adulthood, with many enjoying playing fetch. <br>
      Despite their slender appearance, they are athletic and can leap into high places.<br> 
      They prefer to live in pairs or groups and also seek human interaction. <br>
      Unlike the breed's blue-eyed forebear, Orientals are usually green-eyed.<br> 
      The Oriental Longhair differs only with respect to coat length.</p><br>
   <p>
      While the breed's genetic roots are ultimately in Thailand, <br>
      it was formally developed in the US by a number of New York <br>
      area cat breeders, led by Vicky and Peter Markstein (PetMark cattery), <br>
      who in 1971-72 were intrigued by lynx patterned and solid colored cats of <br>
      a Siamese body type at Angela Sayers' Solitaire Cattery and at Patricia White's.<br>
      These were based on solid-colored cats with the body of a Siamese, bred by Baroness <br>
      von Ullmann over the 1950s. An "Oriental Shorthairs International" was formed in 1973,<br>
      and Peter Markstein presented the breed to the 1976 Annual Cat Fanciers Association, <br>
      at the same time as the Havana Brown was presented by Joe Bittaker.<br>
      In 1977 the Oriental Shorthair was accepted by the Cat Fanciers' Association for <br>
      championship competition.<br>
      Since 1997, it has also received recognition from the GCCF and various other cat breeding <br>
      organizations.<br> 
      The breed is among the most popular among CFA members. </p><br>
